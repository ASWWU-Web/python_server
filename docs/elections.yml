  title: Elections API
  description: The API for the elections project. This includes endpoints to vote along with managing elections. The ORM is split into four objects Election, Position, Candidate, and Vote. Election represents an election that will take place and can be setup by admins. Position is a generic position that candidates can run for. Candidate is an oficial candidate and what tells what position that person is running for. Vote represents a single voter candidate pair, users will cast multiples of these for each election but never for the same candidate.
