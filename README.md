# Le python backend
## Installation
The following python packages need to be installed and they can be installed with the following commands. 
```
pip install pattern
pip install requests
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install tornado
```

Then you need to get a copy of the database file. In your git projects folder run the following command
```
git clone user@aswwu.com:/data/databases
```
The python library looks for the database file in `../databases` so make sure you clone the database repository into the correct place. 
**Note:** This git repo is also used for daily backups to the actual database.
