# REST API for ASWWU
This is a python based REST api that ASWWU web uses for EVERYTHING.

## Installation

**Note:** This uses python 2 so if you don't have that installed, install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The following python packages
(pattern, requests, SQLAlchemy, tornado, bleach, etc.) need to be
installed and they can be installed with the following command.

Linux:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Mac:
```
sudo -H pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed six
```
You should be ready to run the server now.
```
python server.py
```

## Check Installation
You can test the connection by opening [`http://localhost:8888/search/all`](http://localhost:8888/search/all).

If you see a json array of profiles you're all set. Congrats! You now have a clone of the ASWWU backend server running locally!

## Further usage
If you want get a list of other endpoints(urls) that you can query on the server checkout the `server.py` file in the root of this project.

```python
handlers = [
    (r"/login", base.BaseLoginHandler),
    (r"/profile/(.*)/(.*)", mask.ProfileHandler),
    (r"/profile_photo/(.*)/(.*)", mask.ProfilePhotoHandler),
    (r"/search/all", mask.SearchAllHandler),
    ...
    ]
```
From this array you can see that the function that handles the `/search/all` url is part of the mask module. In `./src/aswwu/route_handlers/mask.py` you can see the function that handles this.
```python
# get all of the profiles in our database
class SearchAllHandler(BaseHandler):
    def get(self):
        profiles = alchemy.query_all(mask_model.Profile)
        self.write({'results': [p.base_info() for p in profiles]})
```

## Testing
We have continuous integration working on this project however it doesn't actually use any of the actual python server code. :( You can run a dummy test by running the following command.
```
pytest
```
### Configure Test Coverage in Codacy
In order to get test coverage from Codacy, you must take your specific project API token (generated by Codacy) and set it in your terminal. you can create the token in Project -> Settings -> Integrations -> Add integration -> Project API
set it in your terminal, using the following command but replacing %Project_Token% with your own token:
export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=%Project_Token%
after that, the .travis.yml will take care of the rest.

## Miscellaneous

If you need it the live server is available at [`https://aswwu.com/server/`](https://aswwu.com/server/).
